# ESP32 Hunt Sensor Module Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a Hall Effect sensor with an ESP32 microcontroller to detect magnetic fields. Hall Effect sensors are ideal for detecting magnets or magnetic fields without physical contact, useful in various applications like proximity detection and position sensing.

## Components Needed
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- Hall Effect Sensor Module
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

## Circuit Setup
1. **Connecting the Hall Effect Sensor to ESP32:**
   - Connect the digital output (DO) pin of the Hall Effect sensor module to GPIO pin 15 on the ESP32.
   - Ensure the sensor module's power (VCC) and ground (GND) connections are correctly established.

## Instructions
1. **Setup:**
   - Initialize GPIO pin 15 on the ESP32 as an input using `pinMode()` in the `setup()` function.

2. **Operation:**
   - In the `loop()` function:
     - Read the digital state of the Hall Effect sensor using `digitalRead(hallSensorPin)`.
     - If a magnetic field is detected (LOW state), print "Magnetic field detected!" to the Serial Monitor.
     - If no magnetic field is detected (HIGH state), print "No magnetic field detected." to the Serial Monitor.

3. **Considerations:**
   - **Sensor Orientation:** Position the Hall Effect sensor appropriately relative to the magnetic field being detected.
   - **Environmental Interference:** Minimize interference from nearby magnetic sources for accurate readings.

## Applications
- **Proximity Detection:** Detect the presence of magnets or magnetic materials without physical contact.
- **Position Sensing:** Determine the position of objects with embedded magnets.
- **Security Systems:** Use in magnetic door sensors for security applications.

## Notes
- **Sensor Output:** Hall Effect sensors provide a digital output based on the presence or absence of a magnetic field.
- **Serial Output:** Monitor sensor readings and adjust placement or sensitivity as needed for optimal performance.
